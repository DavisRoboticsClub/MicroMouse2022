This is the repository for the Micromouse project for Davis Robotics Club

### current state:
The micromouse is functional and running a simple obstacle avoidance program.

### Next steps:
#### hardware:
- RGB led wire's connection is intermittent, replace wire or resolder connection
- Solder replacement to aligator chip connection to power switch
- continue testing hardware

#### software:
- Test and integrate IR sensors
- Implement more advanced maze solving logic
